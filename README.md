Automated Number Plate Recognition (ANPR) System
Welcome to the Automated Number Plate Recognition (ANPR) System repository! This project aims to develop a real-time ANPR system using OpenCV and Tesseract OCR. The system captures video from a webcam, detects vehicle number plates using Haar cascades, and extracts text from the detected plates using Tesseract OCR.

Project Overview
The ANPR system uses a combination of image processing techniques and machine learning models to accurately detect and recognize vehicle number plates in real time. The captured frames from the webcam are processed to identify number plates, which are then passed to the OCR engine for text extraction. The extracted text is saved in a structured format for further analysis or storage.

Features
Real-time number plate detection using OpenCV.
Text extraction from number plates using Tesseract OCR.
Save detected number plates and extract text to local storage.
Adjustable detection parameters for optimal performance.
Installation
Prerequisites
Python 3.x
OpenCV
